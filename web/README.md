It consists of a main page that leads to two other pages, where it is possible to see, add and delete TO-DOs that are persisted in the backend server according to Exercise 4, or to a page where the local and UTC date and time are shown according to Exercise 5. 

Note: There is actually no page for Ex6, it's button is just a placeholder.
